                            Cloud providers and database vendors are investing heavily in the development of competitive cloud database offerings, with the goal of providing optimal performance in a cost-effective way for cloud customers. The database community has already contributed significantly towards developing cloud-native OLTP and OLAP databases. Cloud computing pools an abundance of resources and offers them in a pay-as-you-go model. Due to this unique computational environment and business model, there are various research challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges require new research into resource disaggregation, serverless database services, and data movement across multiple cloud providers. Additionally, existing database research topics require re-evaluation such as:

                            Our workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss these challenges as well as possible directions to tackle them. Specifically, the workshop has three objectives. Firstly, it provides a platform for researchers to present their latest research results in the area of cloud databases. Secondly, it provides an opportunity for practitioners to assess the results and provide feedback. Thirdly, and most importantly, it helps researchers and practitioners to build connections and explore potential collaboration.

                                    <span>Abstract:</span> Over 3 decades ago, when the database research community was enamored of shared nothing database management systems (DBMSs), some of us were focused on DBMSs which were based on the shared disks (SD) architecture. While my own work involved IBM’s DB2 on the mainframe, earlier SD product work had been done by DEC, IBM (with IMS), Oracle and a couple of Japanese vendors. The research community didn’t appreciate that much our SD work even though IBM and Oracle have been quite successful with their SD relational DBMS products. With the emergence of the public cloud, many classical on-premises DBMSs have been ported to the cloud arena. New DBMSs have also been developed from scratch to work in the cloud environment. One of the dominant characteristics of the cloud DBMSs is that they are embracing the SD architecture because of the architectural separation of compute nodes and storage nodes (also called disaggregated storage) in the cloud environment to gain several advantages. I feel that these recent developments vindicate our age-old SD work!<br /><br />In this talk, I will first introduce traditional (non-cloud) parallel and
                                    distributed database systems. I will cover concepts like SQL and NoSQL systems, data replication, distributed and parallel query processing, and data recovery after different types of failures. Then, I will discuss how the emergence of the (public) cloud has introduced new requirements on parallel and distributed database systems, and how such requirements have necessitated fundamental changes to the architectures of such systems which includes embracing at least some of the SD ideas. I will illustrate the related developments by discussing the details of several cloud DBMSs.

                                    <span>Abstract:</span> Due to the widespread use of cloud applications, searching for data from cloud servers is ubiquitous. However, accessing data stored in a cloud server comes with severe privacy concerns owing to numerous attacks and data breaches. Much research has focused on preserving the privacy of data stored in the cloud using various advanced cryptographic techniques. Our goal in this talk is to demonstrate how private access of data can become a practical reality in the near future. Our focus is on supporting oblivious queries and thus hide any associated access patterns on both private and public data. For private data, ORAM (Oblivious RAM) is one of the most popular approaches for supporting oblivious access to encrypted data. However, most existing ORAM datastores are not fault tolerant and hence an application may lose all of its data when failures occur. To achieve fault tolerance, we propose QuORAM, the first datastore to provide oblivious access and fault-tolerant data storage using a quorum-based replication protocol. For public data, PIR (Private Information Retrieval) is the main mechanism proposed in recent years. However, current PIR proposals are inefficient especially with large data sets and require the server to consider data as an array of elements and clients retrieve data using an index into the array. This latter restriction limits the use of PIR in many practical settings, especially for key-value stores, where the client may be interested in a particular key, but does not know the exact location of the data at the server. In this talk we will discuss recent efforts to overcome these limitations, using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), to improve the performance, scalability and expressiveness of privacy preserving queries on public data.

                                    <span>Abstract:</span> Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are the backbone for managing large volumes of data efficiently in the cloud. For providing high performance, many of the most complex DBMS components such as query optimizers or schedulers involve solving non-trivial problems. To tackle such problems, recent work has outlined a new direction of so-called learned DBMSs where core parts of DBMSs are being replaced by machine learning (ML) models which have shown to provide significant performance benefits. However, a major drawback of the current approaches to enabling learned DBMS components is that they not only cause very high overhead for training an ML model to replace a DBMS component but that the overhead occurs repeatedly which renders these approaches far from practical to be used for cloud DBMSs. In the first part talk, I will present our vision to tackle these issues. In the second part, I will then outline very recent work on LLM-augmented DBMSs to extend DBMS with new capabilities such as seamless querying of multimodal data which is composed of tables, text, and images.

                                    <span>Abstract:</span> As database systems have moved to the cloud they have progressively taken on more and more cloud native characteristics. They have moved from either lift and shift managed hosting or very functionality limited systems to more full featured, built for cloud systems. The most recent generation of cloud native database systems display many of the characteristics you would expect from any cloud native system (Server less, low cost, self-optimizing etc…). However especially for full featured OLTP systems a number of gaps still exist around either scalability, performance, or full functionality.  In this talk I will discuss what it means to be a truly cloud native database, how existing systems have moved closer to this ideal, and what remains to get to a truly cloud native database system.
